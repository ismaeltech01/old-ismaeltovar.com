Howdy! I'm Ismael Tovar, a freshman at the University of Texas at Arlington interested in starting a career in Software Engineering. As you can tell from my home page, I am always eager to learn more and explore the world around me. I am currently open to summer internship opportunities. You can follow me on any of my social media profiles (links are located in the footer of this website).
