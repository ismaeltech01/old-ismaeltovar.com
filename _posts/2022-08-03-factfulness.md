#### Version: 2018
### Notes:
- #### Introduction
	- How can you make good guesses if your world view is upside down?
	- We focus too much on Drama and have instincts of fast conclusions
	- Be curious, impossible is possible

- #### Gap instinct

	- Don't rely on statistics 100%
	- We focus too much on negative and not on positive improvements
	- Beware comparisons of averages/extremes, they block big picture
	- There are 4 levels of income, in level 4 all others seem poor

- #### Negative instinct

	- ultimate goal is to get to do what we want
	- must not lose hope because of misconceptions/negative thinking
	- Most people feel, not think: selective reporting are focused on negative/extreme
	- Things can be bad, but they can be better
	- Bad news is always reported, Good is almost never reported

- #### Straight line instinct

	- Journalist pick dramatic exceptional people in reports (exceptions)
	- Everything that helps is good in right dosage (stress, food, water, etc.)
	- Generally better income = better health and vice versa
	- Lines do not always continue straight, trends can follow different curves

- #### Fear instinct

	- We tend to imagine the worst case scenario, over exaggerate sometimes
	- When we are in fear, we don't think clearly
	- The world has never been safer, but reporting has increased so much making it seem the opposite because of large awareness on bad events
	- Chemicals can kill people only because of the fear/stress/worry, not because of chemical itself
	- Plane travel has become safer than ever, terrorism is unlikely in level 4
	- Fear vs reality: calculate risks, frightening things get attention easily

- #### Size instinct:

	- World cannot be understood without numbers, but it cannot be understood with numbers alone
	- When resources are scarce, you must learn to use them well (time, energy, stress, money, etc.)
	- 80/20 rule: look for small things that produce most of the results
	- Humans proportioning ability is inaccurate, to avoid this, compare and divide

- #### Generalization instinct

	- Just because it happens one way here doesn't mean its like that in other countries
	- west might no longer dominate in a few years
	- you are not "normal", other people are not "idiots"
	- Money can get stolen and loses value due to inflation
	- Question your generalizations, there are differences between groups, look fro similarities too
	- Vivid examples do not demonstrate big picture
	- Just because it works in one situation doesn't mean it does in all

- #### Density instinct

	- Just because it is one way, or has always been like that doesn't mean that it its destiny or will always be that way
	- Asia and Africa are growing fast, business opportunities, most likely will catch up to west
	- prepare to update knowledge, have a vision
	- cultures can change, they are not static
	- Slow changing is still change, track gradual improvements

- #### Single perspective instinct

	- Simple ideas are attractive, but complexity is sometimes necessary
	- Professionals are not good at everything, we are not experts of everything
	- Numbers are no single solution, nor is medicine, there is not single solution
	- Single perspective can limit your imagination, test your ideas
	- Look for different perspectives, be aware of simple ideas/solutions

- #### Blame instinct

	- It is easy to find someone to blame, when we do, we stop thinking
	- Business, Journalist and refugees are doing good intentions, they are not to blame

- #### Urgency instinct

	- Know when something feels urgent, most of the time it is not
	- take small steps, less dramatic, but more effective
	- If wanting to improve something, measure it
	- Beware of future predictions, good or bad, aren't always correct
	- If someone threatens you with a machete, stay calm and look at them in the eye and ask calmly what the problem is
	- Stay up to date on the info, it sparks curiosity and make better decisions
	- Don't rely on news for understanding the world
	- pay more attention to differences within
